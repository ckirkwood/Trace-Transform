# Trace & Transform (2018)

Trace & Transform is an interactive art installation, developed for a retrospective exhibition of the Jersey Arts Centre Student Art Award.

Hardware controls are mounted beneath a screen, which allows manipulation and transformation of digital images. The images are scanned from a series of photograms that I created in 2010, made using black & white photographic paper and a light source to capture a number of vintage flash bulbs.

The control box was laser cut in 9mm ply, with an Arduino Mega to monitor the hardware inputs and send the data to a Processing sketch, running on a Mac Mini.
